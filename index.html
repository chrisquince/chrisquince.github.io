	<h1>Chris Quince</h1>
	<p>I am an internationally renowned expert in the bioinformatics and statistics of microbial community analysis from next generation 
	sequence data. I am based in the <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/med/research/tsm/microinfect/"> microbiology and infection unit</a> 
	within Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick. I am a Principal Research Fellow funded as part of the 
	<a href="http://www.climb.ac.uk"> MRC CLIMB consortium.</p></a>
	
	<p> My research spans both bioinformatics for improved interpretation of sequence data and statistics for distilling 
	ecological relevant information from the resulting high dimensional data sets. Common themes are the use of probabilistic
	models to address both types of problem and an abiding interest in microbial diversity, both how to detect it and its 
	ecological relevance. I work closely with wet lab microbiologists and collaborate on projects spanning human health and the environment.</p>
	
	<p> I joined WMS in October 2015 and am currently recruiting people into my group. I have a 
	<a href="/studentships">PHD studentship</a></li> available starting in 2016.</p>
