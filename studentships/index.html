	<h1>EPSRC CASE Bioinformatics studentship: Development of novel statistics to study the human microbiome</h1>

  <p>Start date 1st March 2016 – 4 years fully funded to all applicants (UK, EU and international)</p>

  <p>Principal supervisor: Dr Christopher Quince (Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick)</p>

  <p>Secondary supervisors: Dr Umer Ijaz (U. of Glasgow), Dr Barry Murphy and Adrian Smith (Unilever)</p> 

  <p>Microbiomics is one of the most exciting areas of current research. New tools, in particular next generation sequencing, 
  have transformed our understanding of the microbial world. We now appreciate that the human microbiome plays a 
  key role in both maintaining health and in preventing disease. It is also central to Unilever’s research, 
  for instance, understanding the response of the skin microbiome to personal care products.</p>

  <p>This studentship is an opportunity to collaborate with Unilever in developing novel algorithms for 
  interpreting sequence data from microbial communities. We will address the problem of removing sequencing 
  errors from PCR amplicons. The methods used to do this will derive from Bayesian statistics and machine learning.</p>

  <p>The studentship would suit an applicant with a strong quantitative background with experience or interest in 
  Bayesian statistics and computer programming. Some biological knowledge may be a bonus but is not essential. 
  Suitable first degrees would include Mathematics, Physics and Engineering.</p> 

  <p> Applications comprising a CV and letter of motivation should be sent to 
  Dr Christopher Quince (c.quince@warwick.ac.uk) by Friday 12th February 2016. 
  UK and EU students are eligible for funding but exceptional international students will be considered as well.</p>

  <p> This studentship includes full fees and the EPSRC stipend (currently £13,863 p.a.) and an additional Unilever top-up (£4,000 p.a.).</p>
